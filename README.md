 ## description

 This app is created with HTML5 , CSS3 and vanilla javascirpt.\
 sudoku is one of the most popular logical game and the rules are pretty simple, **"every column and row must have all the numbers from 1 to 9."** , **"every square have all the numbers from 1 to 9"** .

As you know there are many many starategies to solve sudoku. 
 In this time I just covered some of them and I did not use any algorithms to solve sudoku.
Just follow the way to solve it manually, such as using pencil and the asign the number to cells.
